  - [ ] List primary research areas (e.g., "2D materials", "graphene", "van der Waals", etc.)
  - [ ] Specify ArXiv categories of interest (e.g., cond-mat.mes-hall, physics.app-ph)
  - [ ] Define priority levels for different topics (high/medium/low)

- [ ] **Specify key researchers/authors**
  - [ ] List collaborators whose papers should always be included
  - [ ] Provide names of key researchers in your field to monitor
  - [ ] Identify competing groups or relevant authors

### **REQUIRED: Notification Preferences**
- [ ] **Choose notification method**
  - [ ] Email notifications (provide email address)
  - [ ] Web dashboard only
  - [ ] File output to specific location
  - [ ] Slack/Discord webhook (if desired)
